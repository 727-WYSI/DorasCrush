#How to customize our bots to meet your needs.

- Replace **'YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN'** with your current Discord bot token.
- Change PREFIX to a different prefix for your bot instructions **(e.g.,!,.,?, etc.).**
- Replace **YOUR_CHANNEL_ID** with the ID of the #new_member channel to which you want the bot to deliver welcome and farewell messages.
